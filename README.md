# MrsWatson Ruby Gem



## Installation

First you MUST have MrsWatson installed. Visit teragonaudio.com to install it.

From the command line, type

  $ gem install mrswatson

## Usage

This is a simple wrapper for MrsWatson, a command line vst host. Not all features are supported at this time but hopefully soon. This is an early release to get it out there and get feedback. For now this is OS X only, but that should change soon as well.
